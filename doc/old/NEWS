  INTRODUCTION
  ------------

It's been a very long time since the last tinyproxy stable release.  I
run my own small business, so that obviously has priority over all
other non-business tasks.  However, I have managed to automate more of
my business, so I now have time to tackle tinyproxy again.  (Email
messages to the mailing list or me personally will actually be
answered in a timely fashion and not just disappear into a black-hole.)

This release only contains bug fixes.  See the summary of changes
below.

If you find any problems with tinyproxy, please post them to the
tinyproxy bug tracking system at Sourceforge:

	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=2632

Discussions about problems with tinyproxy (or general usage
questions) can always be posted to the tinyproxy mailing list.  See
the end of this document for more information.


  CHANGES
  -------

Summary of changes since 1.6.2:

 * Fixed a problem with upstream proxy support from Hans-Dieter.  This
   closes bug 996518.

 * All the fields in the child_config_s structure now use signed
   integers since the servers_waiting variable is a signed integer.
   This ensures all the comparisons are computed correctly.

 * The standard file descriptors (stdin, stdout, and stderr) are
   closed when a production executable is compiled.  They are only
   left open when a debugging version of tinyproxy is created.

 * Fixed some spelling mistakes.

Summary of changes since 1.6.1:

 * Fixed a bug in the filter code when handling comments in the filter
   configuration file.  Closes bug 822226.

 * When installing the HTML documentation, the wrong directory was
   being created.  This is fixed.

Summary of changes since 1.6.0:

 * Fixed an off-by-one error with respect to the MaxRequestsPerChild
   test.  [Fix proposed by Yannick Koehler]

 * Remove the assert on the pointer being NULL since a NULL pointer is
   allowed by the realloc() spec.


 FUTURE
 ------

Here is a list of improvements slated for the next tinyproxy release:

 * Improve the shared memory implementation (maybe using the MM
   library.)


  CONCLUSION
  ----------

tinyproxy is shaping up to be a very useful little tool.  There are
still long term goals relating to making tinyproxy a completely
HTTP/1.1 standards compliant proxy.  Anyone with ideas or patches for
tinyproxy should submit them to the tinyproxy-users mailing list at:

	tinyproxy-users@lists.sourceforge.net

or see the project's page at:

	http://tinyproxy.sourceforge.net/
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyproxy/

Thanks again to all those who have helped to make tinyproxy a more
useful utility.
