Just some (unordered) ideas

 * SSL interception
  - check polarssl, axtls etc.pp.

 * better FTP support
  - OK, FTP seems to work most of the time, but it should revised
    - example: ftp://ftp.gnome.org/mirror/bittornado/icons/index.php

 * Add support for statistics via RRD files.
  - It would be usefull to have statistics available to generate some nice
    usage graphs via rrdtool.
  - I have to check how to do this because librrd.so has a bunch of
    dependencies. Maybe I have to implement my own small rrd library.
